<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>
Video games develop characters, tell stories, display stylized or photorealistic graphics, offer exciting gameplay systems, and present an incredible opportunity for interactivity. In this fun and challenging camp, students experiment with these aspects of video game production by coding and illustrating a series of playable computer video games–even sharing some of their creations with friends on the web! Students make use of traditional and digital media to reflect contemporary hybrid processes, such as sketchbooking, storyboarding, writing, HTML5, JavaScript, Stencyl, sound effect editors, and Wacom digital drawing tablets.
