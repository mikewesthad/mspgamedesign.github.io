title: Build Your Own Adventure
---
 
Using Build Your Own Adventure games, students wrote stories that require players to choose between possibilities, thus affecting the game's outcome. Using JavaScript, students worked from a template to generate the stories. This game shares similar concepts to the Exploratory Game project, which informs students of the multitude of approaches possible for designing one game.
