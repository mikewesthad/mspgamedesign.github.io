  In the exploratory games, students used HTML and CSS to come up with a scenario that requires players to navigate through a story. Pictures and text were handrawn by the student. These projects emphasized the creative process through planning, drawing, scanning images into the computer, and applying them to the site. Students also learned about HTML relationships by creating multiple pages that connect to one another in multiple ways. 

 <ul class= "list-unstyled">
  
  {% for post in site.tags.HTML5 %}

 <li>
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">
      <h3>{{ post.title }}</h3>
    </a>
  </li>


  {% endfor %}

</ul>
