**NOTE: Don't ask for volunteers to answer questions.  Call on individuals.**

- Have a student or two who were doing well come up and play a game at the start of class (**9a-9.15a**)

		- A Dark Room
		- The Dream Machine

	- Refresher HTML Lesson
		- Whiteboard
			- What is HTML?  Every website is just a text file rendered by a browser.

			- What is an attribute? Examples: src, id and href.
			- What is styling? Explain: top, left, width.
			- Write instructions:
				- If you want to load a nonhyperlinked image, use:
					- (first code block at bottom of page)
				- If you want to load a hyperlinked image, use:
					- (second code block at bottom of page)
			- Color-coded examples on projector, or drawing color-coded examples on board
