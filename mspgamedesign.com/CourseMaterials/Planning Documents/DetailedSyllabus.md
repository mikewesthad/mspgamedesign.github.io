# Week 1 #

**Intended Outcome:** Learn about experimental games and learn the process of making a game through designing a series of games in Stencyl and HTML5

## Day 1: What is a game?! ##

*Supplies needed: laptops, paper, colored markers, whiteboard markers, pencils*

- Introductions (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Introduction to us
	- Make name tags
	- Individually fill out index cards (fill out again in session 9)
		- 1) name
		- 2) how do you define a game?
		- 3) list three games you like
		- 4) what part of game design are you most excited about?
		- 5) what part of game design are you least excited about?
	- Icebreaker (name game OR two truths and a lie)
	- Overview and Schedule
		- Write on whiteboard a general outline for the camp
		- Write on whiteboard what we will we cover today
		- We can ask some students to share their answers (from index cards) to what they are most/least excited about here
	- General classroom rules
		- Brainstorming the guidelines with the students
		- Write everything on the board
- What is a game? (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Definition
		- Have a few individuals read their definitions (from index cards) and we'll write them on the board
		- Many people will mention "fun": ask them what does fun even mean?
		- Additional prompt: How does a game differ from comics, movies, books, etc.?
	- What types of games exist?
		- Two whiteboard brainstorming exercises: brainstorming types of games ("genres") and then brainstorming what games can be about ("content").
			- Fighting, Shooter, Adventure, Role-playing, Strategy, Dance, Horror, Simulation, Sports, Puzzle, Platformer, Point-and-click, etc.
			- Portal 2: escape. Braid: epiphanies. Canabalt: speed. Angry Birds: slingshots. Minecraft: construction. Etc.
		- Goal: Games can be about anything and they don't have to be within a "genre"
	- Experimental games (also, playtime!)
		- Show off a large set of experimental games
		- Have students play 1-2 games on laptops
		- Discussion about their "content"
- How does a computer/game work? (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Logic statement exercise: "Play" as Mario
		- Supplies needed: Paper and markers 
		- Break into 4 groups of 6 students
		- In each group, each student will draw a different image on their paper
			- Role one: player; image: Nintendo controller
			- Role two: Mario; image: Mario's symbol
			- Role three: "if" statement about left/right arrow key; image: directional pad arrow 
			- Role four: "if" statement about the jump key; image: NES A Button
			- Role five: "then" statement about moving left/right; image: stick figure taking a step
			- Role six: "then" statement about jumping; image: stick figure jumping
		- Flow: Player presses a button, the "if" statements check the controller, the "then" statements listen to the "if" statements, the "then" statements tell Mario what to do
		- This exercise can be extended:
			- There can be a goal, e.g. getting to the flag
			- There could be a puzzle that two avatars need to solve
	- After the exercise, take a minute to reinforce the concepts that we learned
- Lunch (estimated duration: 1h)
	- Show a movie, show some video game trailers, play 7-Up, or set them loose into the cafeteria
- What does it take to make a game? (estimated duration: 30m)
	- Whiteboard brainstorming to ask what they think needs to go into a game
	- Then organize it into general categories, pull down some examples of the various categories and put them into a slideshow
		- Story
		- Art
		- Programming
		- Feedback & Playtesting
- Stencyl Introduction: Making a Nyan Cat platformer! (estimated duration: 2h30m)
	- Now that we've covered the general ideas behind game development, we can talk specifics
	- Goal: Reinforce the day's concepts through practice
	- Stencyl
		- What is Stencyl and why are we using it
			- Talk about various game engines and what they do
		- Anatomy of a Stencyl game
			- Explain: game, actor, background, tileset, sound, scene, behavior
	- Nyan Cat platformer 
		- Students get in groups (of 2-3) and hop on laptops
		- From loading assets to building a working level with tiles
			- Walk through step-by-step and make sure everyone keeps on the same page
		- Have each group build a level
			- Write down what you want the player to feel (frustration, speed, precision, rhythm, etc.)
			- Plan out the level on grid paper
			- Tweak gravity and velocity
			- Translate it to Stencyl
		- If there's time, play each other's levels



## Day 2: Rules and Stories ##

- Overview
	- Schedule for the day
	- Big concept: storytelling through rules
		- Games to show and discuss:
			-  [Icarus needs](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Stillmerlin/icarus-needs)
			-  [Storyteller Trailer](http://www.storyteller-game.com/p/about-storyteller.html) AND/OR [Storyteller demo](http://www.kongregate.com/games/danielben/storyteller)
			-  [I Wish I Were the Moon](http://www.kongregate.com/games/danielben/i-wish-i-were-the-moon)
			-  **Mild violence warning, so maybe omit this:** [Moon Waltz](http://www.kongregate.com/games/molkman/moon-waltz)
			-  Include some other examples, maybe can something action-y like canabalt
		-  Isolate and talk about how the rules and storytelling go together
		-  Talk about the "classic" story in three acts: setup, conflict, resolution
- Storyboarding
	- What is a storyboard? Walk through example
	- Group storyboard exercise
		- Everyone get up and as a giant group, set up 3 acts of a story in photographs
	- (Possibility of including gesture drawing exercise to loosen everyone up)
	- Individual storyboard exercise
		- Pick a story (book, game, fairy tale, movie, tv show, etc.)
		- Verbally storyboard it, with one sentence for each act
		- Draw the story board 		
		- Possibly have volunteers bring their work up to the front of the class to have us guess at the story
	- Small groups exquisite corpse storyboard 
		- Talk about "yes and" from standup and how you can use that as a model for collaborating
	- (Possible museum trip to find stories in art)
- Discussion about giving feedback and collaborating
	- Covering the content of the last two pages of [this pdf](http://ericzimmerman.com/files/texts/Game_Design_1_syllabus.pdf)
- The rules of a game
	- Take a video game (like one of the ones we player, or something generic like Mario) and have everyone brainstorm all of the rules
	- Now let's take Tic-Tac-Toe (Credit: Eric Zimmerman) 
		- Write out all the rules on the board
		- Have students form groups of three and create a new game by adding/modifying/inverting the rules
		- Pay attention with how exactly the rules make the game feel (is it intense, is it methodical, etc.) 
		- Examples: invert winning condition (you lose when you get three in a row); have players make moves simultaneously rather than sequentially; play blindfolded, etc.
- Make a story game (modeled off of [I Wish I Were the Moon](http://www.kongregate.com/games/danielben/i-wish-i-were-the-moon))
	- The game is a single screen game with click-and-drag sprites.  When sprites are placed in certain locations they trigger text and/or animation.
	- Have everyone write down their act 1, act 2 and act 3 on paper in storyboard form.
	- Translate to Stencyl
	- ...finish fleshing this out


## Day 3: Animation ##
- Animating a walk cycle
	- Stop motion exercise
		- Brainstorming what happens when someone walks (leg placement, arm counterbalance, etc.)
		- Show how walk cycles get translated into games
			- http://www.manningkrull.com/pixel-art/walking.php
			- http://www.fjasmin.net/walk_cycle_tutorial/index.html
			- http://www.angryanimator.com/word/2010/11/26/tutorial-2-walk-cycle/
		- Get everyone up and in front of the room, choreograph a walk cycle 
	- Cut outs
- Making characters out of colored beads
- Animating the movement of animals

		- Etc **[fill these in]** 


### Session 2: Building a complete platformer ###

- **Discussion**: Overview and Schedule
	- Writing (on the whiteboard) what we will we cover today
- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, a platformer with a meaning
- **Activity**: Critical play of **[insert game]**, a game with unique game "feel"
- **Demonstration**: Game feel
	- So far, we've only focused on narrative coming from art, but equally important is the narrative from the mechanics
	- Much like [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com/), we will play with physics and logic to create different feeling games:
		- **ex 1**
		- **ex 2**
		- **ex 3**
- **Activity**: Game feel
	- Complement to the above demonstration
- **Activity**: Adding game feel to your platformer
