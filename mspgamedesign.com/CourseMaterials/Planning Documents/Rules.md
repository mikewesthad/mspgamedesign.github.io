## Feedback ##

Game development is a process.  An essential part of that process is learning how to **both** give and receive feedback.  Making a game requires you to invest a lot of time and energy.  Sometimes, working so hard on the specifics of your project will blind you to how the whole thing feels.  You need someone with fresh eyes to give you their opinion.  At the same time, it can be hard to hear criticism about your work.  

You want to be able to give fellow game makers useful, honest and constructive feedback to help them improve.  You also want to be able to listen to other people's opinions and understand their reactions to your game.

**Giving Constructive Criticism**

- Use a compliment sandwich
	- Start off with saying something you like
	- Suggest something that could be improved
	- Finish by mentioning something encouraging
- Try to give specific feedback
	- If you like a game, try to say what exactly you like about it. If you dislike a game, try to say what exactly you don't like.
	- This allows the person who is receiving feedback to know what to improve and how to do it.
- Be kind!

**Receiving Constructive Criticism**

- Be appreciative
	- Even when someone says something you don't find useful!
	- People will then *want* to give you their opinions
- Stay calm
	- If someone says something that hurts, count to three in your head before responding
	- People can be offensive without realizing it, so if you are still hurt after counting to three, let the person know.
- Ask questions
	- If someone says something you don't understand, ask a question!
	- The whole point of getting feedback is so that *you* have a sense of what areas are working and what aren't
- Always remember: *you* are the game designer
	- Pay attention and try your best to understand the feedback you get, but in the end, *you* decide whether the feedback is useful.
